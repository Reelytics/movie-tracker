# OCR to AI Vision Migration Guide

This guide will help you migrate from the old Tesseract OCR implementation to the new AI Vision-powered ticket scanning system.

## Migration Steps

1. **Set up API Keys**
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` (if not already done)
   - Add your API keys for at least one of these providers:
     - OpenAI: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
     - Anthropic: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
     - Google Gemini: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
     - Azure: `AZURE_API_KEY` and `AZURE_ENDPOINT`

2. **Test the Vision Providers**
   - Run `npm run test:vision` to test all configured providers
   - The first time you run this, it will create a test directory at `tests/vision`
   - Add some ticket images to this directory and run the test again

3. **The API Routes**
   - The API endpoints remain the same:
     - `POST /api/tickets/scan` - Upload and scan a ticket
     - `POST /api/tickets/save` - Save ticket data
     - `GET /api/tickets/tickets` - Get all user tickets
   - New endpoints have been added:
     - `GET /api/tickets/providers` - Get available providers and status
     - `POST /api/tickets/providers/set-active` - Set active provider
     - `GET /api/tickets/providers/test` - Test all providers

4. **UI Updates**
   - No UI changes are strictly necessary as the API endpoints function the same
   - However, you may want to add a provider selector in the ticket scanning UI
   - Example UI additions could include:
     - Provider selection dropdown
     - Provider status indicators
     - Confidence scores for extracted fields

## Benefits of the New System

1. **Higher Accuracy**: AI vision models understand context and can extract information more reliably
2. **Multiple Providers**: Redundancy if one service is unavailable or has limitations
3. **Better Handling of Edge Cases**: These models are better at handling poor quality images, unusual ticket formats, etc.
4. **Future-Proof**: The architecture allows easy addition of new providers as technology evolves

## Removed Components

The following components have been replaced and should no longer be used:

- `server/services/ocr/ocrService.ts` - Replaced by vision providers
- `server/services/ocr/ticketParser.ts` - Replaced by ticketScannerService
- `server/services/ocr/ticketScannerService.ts` - Replaced by new version
- `server/services/ocr/extractors/*` - No longer needed, AI handles extraction

## Testing Your Integration

1. **Run the API and upload a ticket**
   - Start the server with `npm run dev`
   - Use the existing UI or a tool like Postman to upload a ticket image
   - Verify the extracted data matches what's on the ticket

2. **Test with different providers**
   - Try scanning the same ticket with different providers
   - Compare results to see which provider works best for your ticket formats

3. **Check error handling**
   - Try uploading a non-ticket image
   - Try uploading a very poor quality ticket image
   - Verify the system handles errors gracefully
